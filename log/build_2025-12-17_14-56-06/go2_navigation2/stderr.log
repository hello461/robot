[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findunitree_go2_nav_interfaces.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "unitree_go2_nav_interfaces", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "unitree_go2_nav_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    unitree_go2_nav_interfacesConfig.cmake
    unitree_go2_nav_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "unitree_go2_nav_interfaces" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "unitree_go2_nav_interfaces_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "unitree_go2_nav_interfaces"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
